# Simple Text Adventure Game (STAG) assignment

Goal of this assignment was to create a game engine for text based games. The engine reads in a DOT file containing game entities (such as items, NPCs, locations) and an XML
file containing actions that can be performed on these items and the results.

The server needs to respond to the basic commands common in every game, as well as specicic commands from the actions file.

To play the game, you will need to run the server first, and then the client entering a username as an argument. 

<p>
  <h4>The basic commands are as follows:</h4>
    <li>look: show all information about current location</li>
    <li>inventory (or inv): show items in your inventory</li>
    <li>get "item name": pickup an item</li>
    <li>drop "item name": drop an item</li>
    <li>goto "location": travel to a location</li>
    <li>health: display your health</li?
</p>

As an extension, I added in multiplay functionality and health mechanics to the game.
